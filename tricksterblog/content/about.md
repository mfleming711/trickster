This blog is dedicated to code-level discussion of:

* Web Scraping
* Automation
* Growth Hacking
* Bounty hunting
* OSINT

Drawing knowledge and inspiration from multiple communities (software development, growth hacking, cybersecurity, internet marketing, hacktivism, cypherpunk movement, etc.) we're here to provide a subversive take on seeking wealth and freedom in a world that is increasingly dominated by technopolitical superpowers.
