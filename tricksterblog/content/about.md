This blog is dedicated to code-level discussion of:

* Web Scraping
* Automation
* Growth Hacking
* Bounty hunting
* OSINT

Drawing knowledge and inspiration from multiple communities (software 
development, growth hacking, cybersecurity, internet marketing, hacktivism, 
cypherpunk movement, etc.) we're here to provide a subversive take on seeking 
wealth and freedom in a world that is increasingly dominated by technopolitical 
superpowers.
