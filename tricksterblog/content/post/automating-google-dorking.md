There is more to using Google than searching by keywords, phrases and natural language questions. Google
also has advanced features that can empower users to be extra specific with their searches.

WRITEME: talk about boolean operators, duoble-quotes, inurl, site, filetype etc.

Google dorking is using advanced search queries to find finds that are not necessarily meant to be exposed
to the public internet. For example, to find some web cams, one might search:

```
intitle:"Live View/ â€” AXIS"
```

WRITEME: mention GHDB part of ExploitDB

WRITEME: introduce programmatic search API

WRITEME: discuss extra features that are only available on programmatic search

WRITEME: develop some example code that uses programmatic search
