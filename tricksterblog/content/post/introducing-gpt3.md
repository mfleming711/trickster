GPT-3 is large-scale natural language processing system based on deep learning and developer by 
OpenAI. It is now generally available for developers and curious people.

GPT-3 is the kind of AI that works exclusively on text. Text is both input and output for GPT-3. 
One can provide questions and instructions in plain English and receive fairly coherent responses. However GPT-3 is not:

* HAL from _2001: Space Odyssey_
* Project 2501 from _Ghost In the Shell_
* T-800 from _The Terminator_
* AM from _I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream_

What GPT-3 is a tool AI (as opposed to agent AI). Given textual input (prompt) it gives an output based on both the input 
and all the datasets it was trained with. Quality of output is strongly dependant on quality of input. Prompt Engineering
is the practice of crafting inputs for GPT-3 with the objective of acquiring an output of sufficiently high quality.

The simplest way to experiment with GPT-3 is to use the [Playground](https://beta.openai.com/playground). You enter your
prompt into the big text field and press the green button to generate an output. Let us go through various
configuration options on the right hand side.
