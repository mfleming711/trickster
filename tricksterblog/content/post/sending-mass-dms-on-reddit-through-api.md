[Howitzer](https://howitzer.co/) is a SaaS tool that scrapes subreddits for users mentioning given keywords and automates mass
direct message sending for growth hacking purposes. 

Generally speaking, there are significant difficulties when automating against major social media platforms. However, Reddit
is not as hostile towards automation as other platforms and even provides a relatively unrestricted 
[official API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) for building bots and integrations.

Let us try automating against Reddit API with Python to build a poor mans Howitzer with Python.

TODO: review public APIs we will be using and introduce PRAW module.

TODO: write code for scraping users and explain it.

TODO: write code for messaging users and explain it.

TODO: run some experiments and discuss results
