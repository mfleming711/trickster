Bash is a Linux/UNIX program that reads users commands from the users, parses
them and executes the appropriate programs through OS-specific APIs. Since
it covers these APIs and provides some extra features on top of them this kind
of program is called a shell. Bash is not merely an interface between keyboard
and exec(2) et. al. It is also a scripting language and interpreter. As Bash
is available on most Unix/Linux systems it provides a common denominator
scripting language in many development and server environments.

Today we are going to explore various scripting facilities in Bash to learn
about programmable nature of this shell. The following text assumes a basic
familiarity with the world of Linux/Unix software.
