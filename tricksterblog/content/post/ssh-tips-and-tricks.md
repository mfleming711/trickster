SSH is well established protocol for securely accessing remote systems over the 
network for administration and devops purposes. A widely deployed OpenSSH 
software suite implements this protocol. But there is more to the SSH technology
than reaching a remote shell over ssh(1) or copying files via scp(1)/sftp(1).
We will go through some lesser known, somewhat advanced tricks and use cases
that could be valuable in your daily work.
