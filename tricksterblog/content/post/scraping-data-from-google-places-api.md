Google Maps Platform contains large amount of POI (Point Of Interest) data that
one might want to scrape for purposes such as lead generation, real estate
OSINT, academic research and so on. However Google Maps web/mobile apps
are highly complex pieces of software and may prove difficult to reverse engineer
for data extraction. But the very same POI data can be extracted through scraping
the official [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview)
that is free for usage at small scale and is billed at 
[pay-as-you-go](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/usage-and-billing#new-payg)
model at non-trivial volumes. We will go through some basic examples of how this
data can be scraped with Python.
