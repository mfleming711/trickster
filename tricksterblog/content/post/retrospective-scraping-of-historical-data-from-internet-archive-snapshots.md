Some internet research activities are based on not only present data, but also
on accessing historical data that was posted online. We will go through a simple 
example of how scraping pre-crawled pages from Internet Archive Wayback
Machine can be used to gather historical data for data science purposes. We will
be scraping historical snapshots of Iowa Department of Corrections [inmate 
statistics page](https://doc-search.iowa.gov/dailystatistics) to create a 
temporal inmate population dataset and draw some graphs.
