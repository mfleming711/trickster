Introduction and motivation
===========================

We live in the postmodern age of hyperreality. Vast majority of information most people receive through technological
means without having any direct access to it's source or any way to verify or deny what is written or shown on the screen.

A pretty girl sitting in a private jet might have paid a lot of money to fly somewhere warm or might have paid a company 
that keeps the plane on the tarmac a little money to do a photo shoot. Her fans on Instagram have no idea which of these
scenarios are true simply from seeing the picture of her relaxed in fancy seat, looking into distance through her sunglasses 
and sipping wine. That's hyperreality. The same applies to supposedly very successful twenty-something guy in an expensive car
that may or may not have been rented for a day to make an entire months worth of pictures.

In modern information society, attention is money. There are multiple ways to financially benefit from peoples attention
through PPC advertisements, sponsorships, affiliate deals, promoting your own products or by simply selling your audiences
attention to the highest bidder (influencer marketing). Some people have become millionaires or even billionaires by
being able to play the social media game very well. Hyperreality is particularly prevalent on modern social media platforms 
that are deliberately engineered to extract as much time and attention (engagement) from it's users as possible, then
sell it through the integrated ad platform to the highest bidder. Objective truth be damned, Big Social executives will
do anything to keep the people reading, clicking, watching. Large scale virtual reality as it was imagined by science
fiction writers and technologists in 80s and 90s did not happen yet, but virtual *social* reality is already here.

If Big Social business objectives require, the organic reach is deliberately being limited to make more spaces for paid ads. 
Therefore promoting your brand on major social media platforms by playing it straight and relying on organic reach only 
works up to a point. It is still feasible on Tiktok, but less and less viable on Instragram and Facebook. The same applies
to buying peoples attention on social media ad platforms such as Facebook. When social media ad spend is overall increasing
auctions for human attention are getting more and more competitive, thus many business are finding that they are being priced out.
In 2022, it is very easy to burn bunch of money on e.g. Facebook ads only to end up net negative by the end of the quarter.

So if we simply want to make some money, how do we proceed in this crazy world? If Big Social takes away the organic
reach with one hand and charges more and more money for paid ads with another how do we turn a profit? 

One of the feasible answers is growth hacking through gray hat social media automation. Let me elaborate what I mean by 
that. Growth hacking is a kind of marketing that focuses on low-cost, experimental, unorthodox ways to get new customers 
and retain them. Social media automation is use of programmatic techniques and software tools to mainly do things that
some social media manager would be doing manually. In the order of increasing sketchiness, we classify the automation
techniques into three levels:

1. White hat - fully legitimate and T&C-compliant automation, such as posting stuff on schedule through Buffer, ToS-compliant
chatbots and so on. Legit stuff in the eyes of social media platform that nobody would legitimately complain about.
2. Gray hat - automations that explicitly break T&C of social media platform. Somewhat sketchy stuff.
3. Black hat - automations for malicious and criminal purposes, such as phishing, harassment or mass-reporting social
media accounts on fraudulent basis. The evil stuff.

Assuming we don't want to play the dangerous game of truly black hat automation on moral and risk management grounds, why
do we pick the gray hat option? Why not go with white hat automation and do everything in entirely clean way? Well, frankly
that's because white hat automation has no teeth in 2022. We would be merely making an improvement over manual social
media management, but not going far beyond that. Altough Big Social is proactively working against non-whitehat automation 
on technical and legal levels, gray hat automation at least gives us a fighting chance when trying to monetise these
massives audiences on modern massive social networks.

Gray hat social media automation is not an easy thing to do in the post-Cambridge Analytica world, but may provide something
like a cheat code to those trying to make money online. Like in object-orient programming, there are patterns - abstract
principles of doing things that keep popping up when one works in the field or is researching it. We will discuss the
patterns of gray hat social media automation that are more or less applicable to multiple platforms and can be thought
of as theorethical concepts without scrutinizing how exactly they would be implemented.

But refrain from implementing some equivalent of [FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition) 
if you can.
